RUBY-MONSTERS-LESSONS
=====================

The lessons content for the Ruby Monsters coaching sessions 
Please notice that this repository has branches for each of these
classes. Just switch the branch to access desired lesson.

So far we had the following lessons: 

### Introduction to Ruby: 

We had two classes about how the basic ruby works, with the following 
content: 

- what is a variable
- basic ruby language constructs (Hash, Array etc)
- defining our own classes
- creating objects

### Introduction to RSpec: 

We started with writing model and controller spec. 
I have explained what are the tests/specs for and how they
ensure confidence in each line of code that we type. 
Guys got introduced to the concept of Test Driven Development with
writting their tests first to spec the requirements through them.

### Introducion to resources:  

We started by writting each of 7 RESTful methods ourselves in routes.rb 
and at the end when everyone understood the difference between GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP verbs we moved on and used 'resources :contacts'
to auto render our routes. 

Next I explained how the default routing actions map to controller
actions and how these map to corresponding views (naming conventions) 

### Introduction to Heroku

I believe Heroku is the easiest way to start deploying new projects 
and have them accessible online. We did the whole lesson about how 
to use heroku through 'git push' command. There was a brief explanation
of Heroku's philosophy and ideas of what is 'server/dyno'.
