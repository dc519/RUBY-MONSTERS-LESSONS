RUBY-MONSTERS-LESSONS
=====================

The lessons content for the Ruby Monsters coaching sessions 

So far we had the following lessons: 

- Introduction to RSpec: 

We started with writing model and controller spec. 
I have explained what are the tests/specs for and how they
ensure confidence in each line of code that we type. 
Guys got introduced to the concept of Test Driven Development with
writting their tests first to spec the requirements through them.

- Introducion to resources:  

We started by writting each of 7 RESTful methods ourselves in routes.rb 
and at the end when everyone understood the difference between GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP verbs we moved on and used 'resources :contacts'
to auto render our routes. 

Next I explained how the default routing actions map to controller
actions and how these map to corresponding views (naming conventions)
