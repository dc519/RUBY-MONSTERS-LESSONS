BASIC RUBY CLASS 1
==================


During this class I was explaining what is the 'Class' how do we create
our own classes. How do we add methods and call the methods on instance of a
given Class. 

Next we moved to discuss the inheritance and I explained how the methods
from parent class get into the one that inherits it. 

We went through the quick explanation of what is the initialize method
and how it is always being called when we call 'new' method on the class
to create new instance of that class. 

Finally I showed how 'attr_accessor' could be used to quicken the
creation of getters/readers and setters/writers in ruby.
